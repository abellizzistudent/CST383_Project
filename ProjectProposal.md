Project Idea
------------

We have all heard that “pitbulls are one of the most dangerous dog breeds”, but we want to see the data behind it and prove that every dog is different, just like every human is different.  We want to figure out what is the likelihood of a bite incident occurring in a dog’s lifetime based on size, breed and age.  We want to compare this data to people’s perception of how dangerous specific breeds are regardless of size, age, or breed.  The machine learning aspect will be using intelligence to predict the likelihood of a dog biting and hopefully help more people be able to adopt dogs that are better suited for them, capable of handling, and ultimately have every dog end up in a Forever Home.

This dataset tells us the breed groups, primary breed, bite severity, gender, and number of bites.

The New York City Heath Code requires all animal bites to be reported within 24 hours of incident. Reports are made online, through the mail, fax or phone to NYC’s Depertment of Health and Mental Hygene (DOHMH) and data is stored and updated here. Relevant column data for our project includes date of bite, age of dog at the time of the bite, breed type, and sex of the dog.

The dataset contains images of dogs from around the world, organized by breed. We can use this data to help understand breed perception vs what we find in the data for bite incidents.

Enriched dataset including data from Continental Kennel Club, American Kennel Club, and United Kennel Club. Includes height, weight and lifespan data by breed.  
NOTE: Will require our own addition of typical characteristics of the “pit bull” as this is not a recognized breed by any of the clubs. It is generally understood as a mix including any of three specific bull terrier breeds.
